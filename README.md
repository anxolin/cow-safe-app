# üê∑ Your Safe App

This repository contains some boilerplate code to get you started with building a Safe App with built-in swap support.

Read the related tutorial on how to do your own CoW Powered Safe Dapp:

- <https://docs.cow.fi/cow-protocol/tutorials/swap-in-safe-app>

The example app embeds the CoW Swap widget in a Safe App, and allows to change some of the configuration, such as the partner fee, token lists, or theming.

It also show how to handle events happening inside CoW Swap, like the notification on a new trade.
